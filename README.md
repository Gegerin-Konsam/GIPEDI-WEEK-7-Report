### Interaction with Madam Sonal Gupta
I interacted with Madam on 28th June 2021. We discussed the problem at hand regarding the HLS synthesis using C. As i was stuck with the programming syntax and because those where due to the header files. We broke down the debugging to the following steps:
- Read what header files are.
- Find out synthesizeable Header files, is Math.h synthesizeable ?
- Take a working code and change the header files and see if they compile correctly.
- Trace back errors and debug why the codes are not working.
- Ask experts in the relevant domain for specific questions on sites like stackedit,stackio etc.

After this Ma'am aslo instructed that i make a trello dashboard where i could organise what i was supposed to do:

Later on I joined a 2 day seminar/tutorial on 29th June 2021 called _"AI/ML Accelerator Tutorial: C-level Design & Verification Using HLS"_ hosted by Siemens Semiconductors.
from the seminar i leanred :
- System C and C++ are used to perform High Level Synthesis.
- Specific libraries are required to perform Synthesis of hardware components.
- Matchlib.h is one such library that we can use for syntnesis.
- Python with Custom Packages generating HDL is not used for synthesis as all it does it map the function to RTL.
- Developing our own C algorithm and optimizing it is the goal of HLS as the generated RTL will be optimised and it would speed up development cycles by around 30x.
- huge difference of code line comparing HLS and hand coded RTL.
